## 1️⃣ 28-Day Automated AI Trading System

**Level:** Professional / Production-Grade  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Multi-Agent RL, Transformers, GNN, XAI, Flask, Async I/O

This is my **first full-scale project**—an advanced automated trading framework designed to handle Forex and Crypto markets intelligently.  

**Key Highlights:**  
- Modular architecture with 3 main components:  
  - `fetcher.py` – Collects multi-source market data  
  - `AIServer.py` – Command center & API interface  
  - `AIEngine.py` – The brain for analysis, decision-making, and trading  
- Multi-Agent system: Macro Agent, Micro Agent, Risk Agent  
- 8 neural networks for market prediction, risk, and news/graph embeddings  
- Real-time asynchronous processing, robust error handling, and caching

## 2️⃣ 6-Day Numerai AI Challenge System

**Level:** Expert / Research-Grade  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Gradient Boosting, LSTM, Transformer, GNN, RL, Gaussian Processes

A **state-of-the-art Numerai competition framework**, combining **10 diverse AI models** in an ensemble.  

**Highlights:**  
- Era-based preprocessing and Walk-forward training  
- LightGBM, CatBoost, LSTM, GNN + Transformer, Multi-Agent RL  
- Automatic blending of predictions into a robust ensemble  
- Post-submission evaluation metrics included

**Level:** Advanced R&D / Cutting-Edge  
**Tech Stack:** Python, PPO-RL, LLMs, LoRA Quantization, GNN, RAG, Multi-Agent Systems

A **swarm of AI agents for end-to-end game development** across Roblox, Godot, Unity, and Unreal.  

**System Capabilities:**  
- Generate and evaluate game ideas  
- Write, debug, and auto-refactor code  
- Generate tests and documentation automatically  
- Multi-agent collaboration using RAG and knowledge graph memory  

**Key Agents:**  
- Core: Code Generator, Critic, Refinement, Evaluator  
- Support: Test Generation, Documentation, Auto-Refactoring, Game Designer  
- Foundation LLM: CodeGen 2B with 4-bit quantization  
- Knowledge Graph (GNN) + Retrieval-Augmented Generation  

**Future Plans:**  
- Partial code and assets may be released for free  
- Expansion to multi-modal AI (images, 3D models)  
- Support more languages and engines
